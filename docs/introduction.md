This is library of styled React components based on bootstrap v4.
 
Using [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/) and our 
[BootstrapProvider](https://github.com/bootstrap-styled/provider), each component is highly customizable and themes 
are easily created and shared.

You can create your own themes very quickly with the [theming tools](https://github.com/bootstrap-styled/bootstrap-styled).

And with the advanced [theming tools](https://bootstrap-styled.github.io/bootstrap-styled), this library can be used as
the building blocks for more complicated components. These components, or what we call modules, can have the same level 
of customizability and have easily built and sharable themes.
